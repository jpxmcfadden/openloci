Call Slip Fields


Add:
Add site instructions from site table - only in view?
*Time Logs - Ability to enter in multiple at once? Is this a good idea or not?... transient select menu for type, if not a call_slip save category number to table, if it is a call slip, create a text box and type in the number of the call_id and save that to the table.
