Call Slips
	* Add a section for "site notes" - auto get from site. Not entry in form.
	Warantee Type: Like T&M but select which sections / things are billable
	Print Work Order [Action] -> option to print when created
	Use customer_markup to auto-calculate the markup rate. Ability to modify per call slip.
	
	Call Slip PO
		Be able to do partial quantity on PO & move rest to inventory / truck stock (if desired)
		
	Additonal Materials
		instead of lookup - autocomplete (see http://xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4814 for integrating yui_autocomlete w/ pulling an ID)
		show everything / including PO's (in form)
		if autocomplete does not find item, don't add
			- maybe keep a backlog of truckstock items?

		add checkbox for "consumables" & "fuel charge"
		
	Footer Section
		select box w/ multiple options (list)
