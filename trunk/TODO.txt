SOCIAL ENGINEERING
	!! Talk to Janet --> Have Ron call TMS to find out about acquiring the database (hopefully as CSV)

TECHNICAL STUFF

	IMPORTANT
		**IF DATES ARE ENTERED INCORRECTLY (correct is currently "Y-m-d") THE RECORD DOESN'T SEEM TO SAVE RIGHT** FIX THIS!!!!
		Sanitize all inputs - widget:atts:maxlength / widget:atts:size
			- DONE(ish): Accounts Payable, Vendors
		Makes things non-deletable -- add some additional columns for active/inactive
		widget:filters:-limit=0 <-- check if this works (with 0 for *all*), and do it for all lookup widgets (universal option?)

	WANT
		Go through database and change some columns to CHAR instead of VARCHAR.
		USERS: need to get rid of "Please Select" option from dropdown box if possible, or list info another way. Ideally radio buttons?
		When adding a new record, the page title defaults to the first item in the list.


	FUTURE
		Add file upload capabilities for customers/sites/other

		
	MAYBE?
		Change "subtitle?" on Employees to not be the "notes" section - TEMP FIX - disabled visibility in style sheet


	NOTES: adding "widget:atts:size" to a SELECT field keeps it open 'size' many rows
	


	

-->	Accounting
	
		Employees - SEE "SOFTWARE - Payroll.doc" page 7 to 9, for more info on this.
			Timelogs
			? Add emergency contact info?

			If 
		Write new program specificially for timelogs
			
			
		Close out Posted Reports on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis.

		Payroll (Employees) - look at page w/ Janet and figure out what needs to be added and how it should work
			? Full / Part - should this be on employee or payroll?
			? Exemptions
			Direct Deposit - Need to do something with this.
			? Vac Time - how do we want this to work? - accrual?
			? YTD - verify: do we need this? keep track of hours: regular / ot / dt?? / holiday / vac
			
			? Income and Deductions
				- set list that gets filled out?
				- or addative list (compares to the way the "rate codes" table works).
				- what categories need to be here? - get clarification!!
				- income / deductions / contributions

			- "Payroll hours entered through Service billings should flow through to the employee’s weekly payroll details.  I need to be able to add/update employee details for anything that does not flow through from the Service billing. i.e. adding on-call pay, reimbursements, p/r deductions, etc."
			- "Need to have the ability to print monthly check reports, Quarterly Payroll Reports, Annual Payroll reports, Quarterly Unemployment reports, W-2’s, extract to csv file 401k, 401R & 401L data to submit to 401k Administrators."
			- "When an employee makes personal purchase through Airite’s vendor accounts, we setup a tool deduction on the employee’s check to get reimburse for the purchase.  I will need the ability to set up and view the history."

		Chart of Accounts

		Accounts Payable (invoice)
			P.O.	-> lookup to PO's
					-> Auto populate everything from the PO
						- Description, Vendor, General Ledger Coding, Amount (more, if others)

			Editable until posted.
			Batch to review - then post batch.

			Fancyness - "that if I want to reverse an invoice that has already been posted, I can just enter the voucher # in the “Crdt Vchr#” field and it will bring all of the info from the original entry over but with a credit balance"

			-- not entry -- Discount if pay by the 10th / Discount % - off pre-tax amount -- links with Vendors
			
			Journal Entry:
				- Create a "Accounts Payable" Entry w/ status Pending

					- Button: Pending
					- Upon posting: Posted
				- Print Status:

		Accounts Recievable - Ask M.
			
		Purchase Orders:
			Categories => Inventory, Office, Vehicle Repair, Service
			Associate w/ General Ledger
			
		Vendors
			Distribution Code - general ledger code most commonly used for that vendor - when pulled into payables, this code is carried over
			! Terms - most are Net 30 (payable 30 days from invoice), need info on other options... need more information here on what to do about this.
			! Due Days - number of days until invoice is due - is this auto?
			x Discount - % dicount vendor offers (if payed by a certain time) - this links with Accounts Payable
				- Calculate off of the "Pre-tax" amount (TMS does this off post tax, but this is not what we want)
				- Manual Entry
				- % or fixed options
			
			Vendor History - shows all invoices entered, and either open or paid - SEE "SOFTWARE - Vendor.doc" page 5, for more info on this.
				- relationship link to vendor.
		
			x Vendors > TaxID needs to be validation "required" when 1099 is selected.
			!? Look into why "__validate" is slightly b0rked. - won't print params... only prints "errors" when using the $record. - VENDORS section (1099/TaxID)
			Add show/hide field for checkbox in vendors section

		Inventory
			Add "markup" calculation
			"List Cost"
				- This is "most recent" cost
				- Add "average" (calculated)
				- Ability to reset average (button)

-->	Service

		Call Slips:
			Time Logs:
				Only print if:
					- Depart Time > Arrive Time
					- Arrive & Depart Time exist!
			Inventory sale cost - add the ability to override (field in grid - using JS)
			Invoice ---- ADD an option to include an ATTN under "Bill To" above billing address.
					---- ADD an option to include information below the materials
					---- ADD an option for "Fuel" or somesuch... "Misc additionals"
					---- ADD "Total Cost"
			Add options to:	close a call slip

	
		Customer
BETH -->	!x Billed to Date / Total Due
				How does this work in the current system?
				AUTO - w/ manual button to confirm (check if correct?), but modifyable?
			! Total Contract Amt - what is this? do we need?
			! Adjustments - do we need?
			Some sort of history (Year / Term / Price) - Possibly needs option to "Close the year"
			
			Select Customer -> Select Site ... if clicks on Site first, can we get it to auto-select the customer? should these two fields just be combined?
